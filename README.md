# Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition
Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition (DB-VMD) is a signal decomposition method and a generalization of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). In particualr, DB-VMD addresses the constant bandwidth bandpass filters used in VMD by rendering them dynamic bandwidth bandpass filters. 

### The repository is structured as follows:
- *Method_Scripts* folder: Script implementations of DB-VMD and VMD
- *Experiments* folder: Experiment scripts about **tone seperation** and **noise robustness**. Also, a script named **visualize_methods.m** is added for visualizing DB-VMD and VMD

User should run the scripts included in the *Experiments* folder.
