# Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a siganl decomposition method, based on optimization theory and variational models. Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition (DB-VMD) is generalized method, addressing the constant bandwidth bandpass filters used in VMD.
