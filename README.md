# Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition
Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition (DB-VMD) is a signal decomposition method and a generalization of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). In particualr, DB-VMD addresses the constant bandwidth bandpass filters used in VMD by rendering them dynamic bandwidth bandpass filters.
