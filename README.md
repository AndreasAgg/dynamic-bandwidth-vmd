# Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition

**Authors**: Andreas G. Angelou, Georgios K. Apostolidis, Leontios J. Hadjileontiadis

**Brief introduction**: Dynamic Bandwidth Variational Mode Decomposition (DB-VMD) is a signal decomposition method and a generalization of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). In particualr, DB-VMD addresses the constant bandwidth Wiener filters limitation of VMD and proposes a scheme for Wiener filters with dynamic bandwidth. Experiments in synthetic signals underscore DB-VMDâ€™s superior noise robustness and adaptability in comparison to VMD, paving the way for many applications, especially when the analyzed signals are contaminated with noise.

## The repository is structured as follows:
- *Method_Scripts* folder: Script implementations of DB-VMD and VMD
- *Experiments* folder: Experiment scripts about **tone seperation** and **noise robustness**. Also, a script named **visualize_methods.m** is added for visualizing DB-VMD and VMD

### User should run the scripts included in the *Experiments* folder.
